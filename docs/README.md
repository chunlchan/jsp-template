# JSP Templates Documentation

A collection of web experiments built with the [jsPsych library](https://www.jspsych.org/). The jsPsych documentation is very helpful and definitely worth checking out. The [list of plugins](https://www.jspsych.org/latest/plugins/list-of-plugins/) is particularly useful, as it highlights the key components used in these templates.

The template currently available in this repository are:

- [Transcription Task](/transcription_task.md)
- [Forced Choice Task](forced_choice_task.md)
- [Flanker Task](flanker_task.md)
- [Background Noise Task](bg_noise.md)

## Overview
Each template is a single standalone html file that can be run in a browser. In some cases, additional files may be required (such as audio files) which will be available in the same folder.

## Where to start?
The [Flanker Task](flanker_task.md) is the simplest and a great starting point. Once you're comfortable with it, feel free to explore the other tasks

## Where to next?
You'll eventually need a live website and database to host your web experiment. The quickest way to get this upand running is to sign up for a [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com) account. Firebase setup instructions are [available here](firebase.md)
